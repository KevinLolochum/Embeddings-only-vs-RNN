# Embeddings vs RNN added embeddings

In this repo, I compare the performance of an RNN model with a simple embeddings model for a text classification task.
Although RNNs are assumed to be better than their predecessors because of the ability to keep important parts of a sequence deep into the layer, this was not the case for the first classification task.

Future models in this repo will involve complex NLP tasks.
