# Embeddings vs RNN added embeddings

In this repo, I compare the performance of RNN models with a simple embeddings model for a text classification task.
Although RNNs are assumed to be better than their predecessors because of the ability to keep important parts of a sequence deep into the layer, this was not the case in this task.

Both models acheived ~80% accuracy even though the embeddings only model was much simpler.

Future models in this repo will involve comparison on complex tasks.
