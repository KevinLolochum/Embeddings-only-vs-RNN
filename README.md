# Embeddings vs RNN added embeddings

In this repo, I compare the performance of an RNN model with a simple embeddings model for a text classification task.
Although RNNs are assumed to be better than their predecessors because of the ability to keep important parts of a sequence deep into the layer, thiscase task.

Both models acheived ~80% accuracy even though the embeddings only model was much simple.

Future models in this repo will involve complex NLP tasks.
